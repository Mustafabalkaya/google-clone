## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial. 

In this video, we will create a Google Clone app. We're going to use React and Goole Search API powered by https://rapidapi.com.

By the end of this video, you will become the master of working with APIs.

To run this project, you need to set up the following environment variables in a .env file in your project's root directory:
```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_API_HOST=your_api_host
```
Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` to start the development server
