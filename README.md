# Goggl - The Most Unique Search Engine in the World

![Goggl](https://i.ibb.co/yQdYhtq/image.png)

## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial.

In this video, we will create a Google Clone app. We're going to use React and Google Search API powered by https://rapidapi.com.

By the end of this video, you will become the master of working with APIs.

Setup:
- run `npm i && npm start` to start the development server

You need to add a .env file to this code and it should contain the following:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_API_HOST=your_api_host
```

The .env file is used to store sensitive or secret information for your project. By defining the `REACT_APP_API_KEY` and `REACT_APP_API_HOST` variables here, you ensure that this information can be accessed securely in your code. Replace `your_api_key` and `your_api_host` with the API key and host information provided by your API provider.
```
