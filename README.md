![Goggl](https://i.ibb.co/yQdYhtq/image.png)

## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial.

In this video, we will create a Google Clone app. We're going to use React and Google Search API powered by https://rapidapi.com.

By the end of this video, you will become the master of working with APIs.

## Setup
To run this project, you need to set up the following environment variables in a .env file in your project's root directory:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_API_HOST=your_api_host
```

Replace `your_api_key` and `your_api_host` with the actual API key and host provided by your API provider.

After setting up the environment variables, run the following commands to start the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

This will install the required dependencies and start the development server.
